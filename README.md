# flowliga-automatik
Tool to automatically generate game reports for [FlowLiga Online Darts League](https://www.dartzentrum-augsburg.de/flow-dartsliga) from [lidarts](https://lidarts.org) games api.


Graphics in assets are placeholders with the same dimensions as the leagues actual ones and should be replaced with graphics from folder assets_live in build script (to be added).
The original graphics are excluded from this repo since I hold no rights to them and am not associated to the league.

Patters in app_data/patters.txt are placeholders and should be replaced with patters.txt from app_data_live in build script (to be added).
